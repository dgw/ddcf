DOWNLOADING--
ddcf    <- is for Linux, BSD, and Unix derivatives.
ddcf.py <- is for Windows.

REQUIREMENTS--
Python 2 with SSL support.
CloudFlare account (Free will do, DNS doesn't change for Pro accounts.)
Internet connection
CloudFlare API key (Freely available, see `Account' tab on http://www.cloudflare.com/)

SETUP--
Open up the script in Notepad, Gedit, or whatever text editor you'd like, and edit the following lines...
    emailAddress		= None		# Set this to your CloudFlare Email.
    APIkey			= None 		# Set this to your API key.
And also, if you'd like, edit this line too.
    defaultHostname		= None 		# Set this to your default hostname
The last line.. DO NOT EDIT IT. It's not made to be edited, but still is there to allow neutrality.
See documentation for editing the last option.

USING--
The most basic command is `update' or `u'
    $ ddcf u
This will get your IP from an outside source (specifically http://canhazip.com/), and updates the default hostname (set in the program, see SETUP) with this IP.

See full documentation at http://git.eitak.se/ddcf/doc.html
Or invoke:
    $ ddcf help
